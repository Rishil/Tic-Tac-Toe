* If a player places three markers in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally, that player wins. Otherwise, the game will end as a draw.

* The scores for each player are displayed on the left and right-hand sides of the board.

### Player vs AI

The player can take turns with the AI and the same evaluating conditions as above will be used to check if there has been a win or draw.
